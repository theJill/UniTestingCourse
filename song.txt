All God's children need travelling shoes
Drive your problems from here
All good people read good books
Now your conscience is clear
I hear you talk, girl
Now your conscience is clear

Look, my eyes are just holograms
Look, your love has drawn red from my hands
From my hands you know you'll never be
More than twist in my sobriety
